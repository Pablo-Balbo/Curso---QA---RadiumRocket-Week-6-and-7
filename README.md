# Curso-QA---RadiumRocket
This repository was created by Pablo A. Balbo for the sixth week of the Radium Rocket "Become a QA" course.
The weekly objective was to copy the html structure of a news from a web page.
The contents learned in class were used, as well as what was learned in the asynchronous material.
On March 19, the "index.html" file was updated, as it needed changes suggested by the class tutor.
This is the original web page: https://www.lacapital.com.ar/ovacion/impactante-video-se-cayo-una-pantalla-gigante-y-aplasto-un-periodista-deportivo-n2646545.html
